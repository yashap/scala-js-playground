# Scala.js Playground

Just me playing around with Scala.js

## Dependencies

You'll need `sbt 1.x.x` installed to build this project.

## Dev Workflow 

```bash
# Build (and watch, i.e. auto-rebuild on changes) a dev version of the JS bundle
make dev/build

# Open the dev version of the web app
make dev/open

# Run the unit tests
make test
```
